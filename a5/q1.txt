The Weeping Angels turn to stone when they are observed. At first, it might seem like it's a
deadlock, since they are unable to progress when there is a set of eyes on them. However,
in order for a deadlock to occur, there are several conditions that must be met. These include
several processes holding a resource while waiting for access to a resource held by another
process. However, because there is no such shared resource that the weeping angels are trying to
acquire, then there is no deadlock. Rather, there is a livelock since there is no progression,
despite there being no shared resource that the angels are trying to acquire. Another way
to prove it is a livelock is by conducting the cardboard test -- since putting a cardboard between
the angels would resume their movement, then it is an indication that they aren't blocked inside
the critical section already, but are not in it yet and simply having indefinite postponement.
