The barrier implementation is faster than the semaphore implementation, which is faster than the
multiple condition locks and owner locks implementation, although the differences are not that significant.
I speculate that MC is the fastest since it allows barging, so there's less time spent on unneccessary
waiting. Additionally, since semaphores and barriers are abstractions, they come with the tradeoff
of being less optimized for the situation, and more generic. For example, barriers have implicit
mutual exclusion, which is not necessarily needed for optimal speed.
